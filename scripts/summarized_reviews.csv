Stayed 13 nights in Deluxe Room which was large with walk in robe & luxury bathroom, separate bath & Walk in shower. Beds were very comfortable & the room was spotless I would rate this as a 10 star Hotel, if there was such a rating. My only request would be to also add drinking chocolate sachets as not everyone drinks either tea or coffee. All staff were amazing, courteous, friendly & always greeting with a smile from Reception to room servicing staff & the front porters. The room has individually controlled air-conditioning, which was beneficial in the heat wave & humidity experienced in July 2022. When staying for a longer period, try to negotiate a better than standard room charge as it is a high class Hotel with room charges accordingly. It is definitely worth treating yourself to some luxury.…",stay in Deluxe Room which was large with walk in robe & luxury bathroom. room has individually controlled air-conditioning and was beneficial in the heat wave and humidity experienced in July 2022."I have never felt more welcome at a hotel/restaurant. From the greeter and security at the front door, to the maître D, to wait staff. The service was spectacular and a dinner we will never forget.

We arrived far too early for our room to be ready, and were delighted to be welcomed so warmly by Herr Esposito at the front desk, who not only assured us it was no problem, but also immediately invited us to the breakfast restaurant to start our day.   I must mention what was probably the best breakfast I have enjoyed at any hotel: the food and the outstanding service there set the tone for the rest of our short stay... Superb.   We were lucky, as our junior suite was upgraded to a beautiful full suite, which, together with the exceptional personal and friendly service made us feel that we were treated like royalty.   Some examples of the great service from various members of staff: happily offering to clean some marks from my wife's shoes, providing advice tailored to our interests for walking around the parks and the locality, the restaurant staff with their brilliant anticipation and their recommendations and offering to ""find anything not seen on the menu"" at breakfast and dinner, and some maids who were happy to guide us to where we needed to be in the hotel. All of this was delivered with a smile and in impeccable English (my German is not as good as it should be!)   Being brought a bowl of strawberries with with our drinks on the rooftop terrace was an unexpected treat, too.   Our suite, the restaurants, bars and the public areas were all extremely clean, tidy and well-presented. The ambience was that of traditional refined luxury in a truly grand hotel.  Overall, a most impressive hotel, in a very well located and beautiful building, staffed with with delightful people who care about their guests.   Vielen Dank to all of those who looked after us so well.

Hotel is superbly located in the heart of the city overlooking Inner Alster Lake, with walking distance to upscale shopping, Laeizhalle concert hall and many sights which is very convenient. Very old-worldly elegant (not stuffy), but cozy decor, hotel really has a sense of place and is spotlessly clean. Front desk, concierge, room service, breakfast team, all super efficient and super nice despite very busy weekend and full occupancy. Only little point for criticism: doorman could have been a little bit more proactive in helping with unloading car/luggage. We will return for sure when in Hamburg next time.

If you're used to what a five-star grand hotel can be in places like Paris, Zurich, Dubai or major Asian cities, then the rooms and wellness area at the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten will probably underwhelm. The guestrooms could be in any corporate chain hotel, while the wellness facilities seem like an afterthought (long, blank corridors; a tiny, aging sauna and little else).
