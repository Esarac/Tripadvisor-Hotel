We arrived far too early for our room to be ready, and were delighted to be welcomed so warmly by Herr Esposito at the front desk, who not only assured us it was no problem, but also immediately invited us to the breakfast restaurant to start our day.   I must mention what was probably the best breakfast I have enjoyed at any hotel: the food and the outstanding service there set the tone for the rest of our short stay... Superb.   We were lucky, as our junior suite was upgraded to a beautiful full suite, which, together with the exceptional personal and friendly service made us feel that we were treated like royalty.   Some examples of the great service from various members of staff: happily offering to clean some marks from my wife's shoes, providing advice tailored to our interests for walking around the parks and the locality, the restaurant staff with their brilliant anticipation and their recommendations and offering to ""find anything not seen on the menu"" at breakfast and dinner, and some maids who were happy to guide us to where we needed to be in the hotel. All of this was delivered with a smile and in impeccable English (my German is not as good as it should be!)   Being brought a bowl of strawberries with with our drinks on the rooftop terrace was an unexpected treat, too.   Our suite, the restaurants, bars and the public areas were all extremely clean, tidy and well-presented. The ambience was that of traditional refined luxury in a truly grand hotel.

Lastly, the hotel is located in a part of the city where it is relatively quiet, so although being in the center of the city, it is very relaxing to stay here. Highly recommendable.

We found that breakfast was a really good German buffet with a short-order chef to prepare egg and other dishes to order. Dinner was very good and is probably the best hotel dinner on the island with a good wine list to match. Service at breakfast and dinner was both friendly and efficient ( though one course was inexplicably delayed one evening). The pool, wellness and spa areas are very new and really excellent. It was just surprising that more guests weren't using them especially as the weather was wet on a couple of days. The room unfortunately was less good. It was a split level room with a comfortable bed and plenty of hanging space but the bathroom was minute  and the shower was micro- sized with doors that only half opened before jamming against the WC. There was a kettle and cups in a kind of kitchenette but no tea or coffee provided and the mini bar was not serviced for the last 2 days of our stay. We didn't have time to make a call to reception and wait for it to be sorted. WiFi is available in room. It is a strange system which we've never seen before but the main thing is it works.

The good points were that the room was very comfortable and clean and the location of the hotel was excellent for exploring the city. The bad point was that neither BA nor the hotel advised us, either in advance,or when we arrived that the restaurant would be shut for evening meals for the full length of our stay and therefore there would be no ‘fine dining’ at the hotel for us ! We did not find this out until our second night when after a long day’s walking and sight seeing we returned to the hotel and tried to book a table. It was at this stage we found out that we would have to go back out to eat as we did not want to eat in the bar. According to the information in the hotel the restaurant is open from Tuesday to Saturday. Surely someone should have advised us of this situation as we would not have booked the hotel if we had know. Or maybe that was the reason we were not told ?

On check-in we decided to upgrade to a suite which was a very large sitting room facing the Dom, a large bedroom and bathroom.  the bathroom is in need of upgrade, it had a bath/shower combo which was very high to climb into, not ideal. A walk-in shower and separate tub would always be my preference. The wi-fi was patchy and not available in the bedroom, I had to ask for a plug-in hotspot for that room. The TV only had one English speaking channel, BBC News even though it listed various others, ITV etc. these were not available - I did mention this to the front desk but they couldn’t help.  The breakfast in-room dining was misleading, it did not mention that there was one inclusive price for everything. We ordered tea first in the morning which duly arrived (there was no kettle in the room) and later we ordered a basic breakfast of a bakery basket and cheese/meat plate - for this they charged 60 EUR (all inclusive breakfast price) however they also charged the tea service seperately at 19 EUR - I did talk to the front desk and they did reduce it by 30 EUR however not great value and to be honest, with a suite upgrade that we paid for it would have been nice if the rate included breakfast.

Nice touches like free minibar and ultra quick room service with some home made sweets. Hotel interior was nicely decorated for festive season (also exterior as well, not just inside), with special attention to Ginger House at the lobby, where the kid got complimentary treats, as well as we bought back home traditional Stollen.  Breakfast was good and included for LHW members, yet the room itself was very dark, with dimmed lights, which perhaps is nice for a dinner, but looks strange at the breakfast time.

I was extremely shocked when first I have received an answer, that they can only book me one hotel restaurant, as the other one is fully booked. And they refused to book me something in the city, explaining that they focus on own restaurants (!!!) and they want to avoid situation with giving my personal data to external places.  Having such a respond I thought that maybe I was not lucky enough and my request reached a trainee, so I responded that focusing on their own restaurants mean for me, to be on a waiting list for one dinner and leaving me without any support for the one outside the hotel. And then real shock came, as I have received an answer from Guest Relation Manager, just repeating all arguments used before by another hotel employee. This is not the approach which I’m expecting from 5-stars hotel with price per night > 300 EUR.

The Bad: The main building rooms have seen better days, and the bathrooms, bedding and mattresses need a refresh given the prices being charged.  A basic at a five star hotel is a quality mattress and this was missing in the main building.  The food offerings - an integral part of any great hotel - are absent/ lacking.

Easiest to reach by car, but reachable with public means of communication (bus from Flensburg). Shaped as an overgrown wooden villa Alter Meierhof houses a variety of rooms and suites, many facing the waterfront and garden.  Public areas are very nice and the stunning flower arrangements and overall freshness of the lobby and ground floor are impressive. The dimensions are perfect for a sense of both luxury and intimacy. The staff at the reception kind and helpful and what you'd expect on a five-star level.  The rooms are however somewhat tired and radiates a feeling of the (19)90-ies. Nifty bathrooms and comfortable beds for sure, but the need of an upgrade is evident. Heavy keys for the door instead of key cards (useful if you are more than one) is annoying. What is most appalling for a five star hotel is the lack of air condition! Well... On second floor under the roof it can get pretty hot in the summer.  Alter Meierhof houses three different eating options: First, there is the two Michelin starred ""Meierei Dirk Luther"", which we would have loved to try - but alas closed for vacation. The ""Brasserie"" was the option and I have reviewed it here on TA separately. Stylish ""semi fine dining"" with good food, lovely setting outside (in the summer), a tad over expensive and with slow service. Third option is the ""Bodega"" - a small room like a wine cellar with a Spanish theme. Kitchen obviously the same, but the tapas/Espagnol is what is presented. Very nice little cosy room for a few couples/singles. We didn't try it, but it looked as a good option.  The slow service at the Brasserie was our main concern for not giving this five star establishemt five stars, so to speak... Obviously understaffed with veeeery long waiting time between the dishes. NOT what I - or you - should expect and accept from a five star ""superior"" hotel.  OK - vacation time and a hard time post covid to get qualified staff. But no, not OK to have a dinner with two courses during two hours and forty minutes.... Must be sharped up - i. e. management: staff your floor appropriately!  Another major fault was that I sat down at the pool area in the evening (at tables for drinks and food) - and was waved away by a waiter! ""You can't sit here if you don't wear svimming clothes"". I was properly dressed for dinner.  My God - staff can't wave people away in a five star hotel! Major fault!  The five stars of a hotel is NOT golden knobs in the bathroom. It's all about service quality and level! Here Alter Meierhof alas doesn't deliver.  But coming to the spa part, this is where the hotel really shines. All types of ""spa:ing"" you can think of with differently tempered hamams, saunas, cool pools etcetera. In this respect Alter Meinhof excels. A treat and we enjoyed!  On the whole it was nice to stay here, but the shortcomings I've mentioned above do manifest that what's on the sign at the entrance (""five star superior""), just isn't true. And I have plenty of reference...  Breakfast very good, with an extensive assortment of any kind of breakfast ingredients you might long for. Parking available outside at a fee - and the parking lot was crowded.  If you have the budget - because Alter Meierhof is a bit over priced and uneven - you could well try it. And hope that the management improve staffing to live up to the five plus ""superior"". It's what it's all about...…"Alter Meierhof Vitalhotel,bubble_45,,"Uferstrasse 1, 24960 Glucksburg, Schleswig-Holstein Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g198450-d236641-Reviews-Alter_Meierhof_Vitalhotel-Glucksburg_Schleswig_Holstein.html,bubble_50,Date of stay: July 2022,1 Helpful vote,Amazing hotel and spa - Professionel people all over the hotel.

Rooms, at least at the lower floors with view to the sea, are ok though it is somewhat strange to have a bath (separate toilet) without a door. Breakfast is not impressive, e.g. the selection of cheeces and sliced meat are limited. The breakfast is not something you would expect from a 5-star hotel. Staff is nice, but lack overview. The spa area is too small and limited. If the hotel is full you almost sit on top of other guests in the sauna and steam baths (only these 3 options).

I did inform the hotel that I don't eat fish and shellfish, but the staff at the brasserie wasn't informed. Secondly I did in advance ask for a neck supporting pillow, which never turned up.

The entire facility is a weird dichotomy of relaxing luxury and a blatant, noisy moneygrab, and as a whole, we are somewhat underwhelmed if not a little disappointed. I'll break it down:  THE GOOD: - The surrounding area is beautiful, and if you get a room with a view of the water, you'll spend hours looking at it. - The service is (mostly) impeccable, at least with regards to the front desk, concierge, cleaning and room service, and spa personnel. - The rooms are outstanding. Clean, spacious, quiet, and cozy. - The spa treatments are fantastic. We had the haram treatment and full body massages, and left feeling like royalty. - It's nice and quiet just about everywhere. - The bar has an impressive menu, and the breakfast buffet carries everything you could ever ask for.  But there is also the MEDIOCRE or outright BAD: - The entire spa area consists of a few small saunas, a small cold-water basin, and a single large pool that extends to the outdoors. There are no hot water basins, and not even a proper jacuzzi – instead, the large pool has a small area with a semi-broken ""air dispenser"". That's it. Honestly, this surprised me. I've visited many cheaper, vastly better equipped German ""therme"". - The famed Michelin-starred restaurant was stylish and (mostly) tasty, but honestly not as great as we'd hoped. We were treated to a lot of food, but amongst it was bland stuff like chewy lobster (with a consistency like rubber). Something in that six-course menu managed to upset our stomachs, which lasted well into the following morning. - The brasserie food was more down to earth, but the room (dare I say hall?) was unconfortably hot and noisy, and the waiters were rushing around like headless chickens. No-one bothered to actually present what we were eating, some waiters refused to even communicate if we didn't speak German from the first second, and the horrible acoustics made conversation almost impossible. It felt more like an airport McDonalds than an expensive brasserie. The entire three-course meal was crammed down our throats in just 90 minutes – usually, we'll spend twice or thrice that time on the same amount of food.  As a whole we enjoyed our little getaway, and the spa personnel deserve praise for their fantastic treatments.

The setting, overlooking acres of wooded valley, is blissful, & the hotel offers a multitude of terraces to revel in these vistas. Restaurants, rooms, spa, & gym, all enjoy stunning outlooks. We loved our 5 roomed Landhaus suite, so spacious & light. Views from both main rooms were wonderful & had either patio doors or myriad windows. Decor in these suites is classic, with comfort & quality the aim. Fab shower, tons of wardrobe space & ample hangers. The only downside was that one bedroom was over a restaurant & was a tad noisy. So we opted to move to a quieter Spa Suite. These rooms are separate from the main house, within the newer spa complex. Whilst we adored the Landhaus Suite, Spa Suites are in a different league. Decor is more contemporary, more chic, & with little enhancements such as nicer bathroom products. Our particular suite (249) was on a corner & enjoyed a fabulous wraparound terrace. This really is a super room. Unfortunately none of the rooms have AC, which is probably not an issue 10 months of the year, but was quite a problem during our scorching July stay when temperatures hit 40 degrees. This meant leaving windows open on a night to aid sleep, which even in the Spa Suites exposed us to noise from the bar/restaurant. We requested a fan which helped mitigate the muggy air a little.   Other guests were mainly German during our stay, just a handful of fellow English visitors. I felt that a little bit got lost in translation when booking by email, but once here we found reception staff to have excellent English skills & to be really switched on - in addition to being really helpful & warm. Restaurant staff were also charming with a very friendly, can do attitude, though service was often painfully slow & odd things forgotten. Easy to forgive when people are so nice though. Dining here is a gourmet affair, we took the Half Board package which entailed a generous breakfast & 5 course dinner. Food was by & large excellent - accomplished & beautifully presented. The hotel also has a renowned, uber fine dining restaurant ‘Eisvogel’ which offers a tasting menu varying from 5 courses (€120) to 9 (€192). Breakfast was a super buffet spread plus live egg station. And it’s always a big thumbs up from me when fizz comes as part of the breakfast offer. Excellent, speedy service too. The hotel is big on the wellness front, with a very nice spa & various sauna/relax rooms. Beautifying isn’t my bag but I used the gym which was pretty well equipped with high quality machinery & a divine outlook over countryside. However, I did feel the gym fell second fiddle to the other wellness areas as there was no water provided & often no towels, & in contrast to the rest of the hotel which is utterly pristine, gym equipment could have done with a wipe down. The hotel boasts an indoor & 2 outdoor pools plus various attractive lounging areas. In addition there are complimentary bikes & a golf simulator.

The setting, overlooking acres of wooded valley, is blissful, & the hotel offers a multitude of terraces to revel in these vistas. Restaurants, rooms, spa, & gym, all enjoy stunning outlooks. We loved our 5 roomed Landhaus suite, so spacious & light. Views from both main rooms were wonderful & had either patio doors or myriad windows. Decor in these suites is classic, with comfort & quality the aim. Fab shower, tons of wardrobe space & ample hangers. The only downside was that one bedroom was over a restaurant & was a tad noisy. So we opted to move to a quieter Spa Suite. These rooms are separate from the main house, within the newer spa complex. Whilst we adored the Landhaus Suite, Spa Suites are in a different league. Decor is more contemporary, more chic, & with little enhancements such as nicer bathroom products. Our particular suite (249) was on a corner & enjoyed a fabulous wraparound terrace. This really is a super room. Unfortunately none of the rooms have AC, which is probably not an issue 10 months of the year, but was quite a problem during our scorching July stay when temperatures hit 40 degrees. This meant leaving windows open on a night to aid sleep, which even in the Spa Suites exposed us to noise from the bar/restaurant. We requested a fan which helped mitigate the muggy air a little.   Other guests were mainly German during our stay, just a handful of fellow English visitors. I felt that a little bit got lost in translation when booking by email, but once here we found reception staff to have excellent English skills & to be really switched on - in addition to being really helpful & warm. Restaurant staff were also charming with a very friendly, can do attitude, though service was often painfully slow & odd things forgotten. Easy to forgive when people are so nice though. Dining here is a gourmet affair, we took the Half Board package which entailed a generous breakfast & 5 course dinner. Food was by & large excellent - accomplished & beautifully presented. The hotel also has a renowned, uber fine dining restaurant ‘Eisvogel’ which offers a tasting menu varying from 5 courses (€120) to 9 (€192). Breakfast was a super buffet spread plus live egg station. And it’s always a big thumbs up from me when fizz comes as part of the breakfast offer. Excellent, speedy service too. The hotel is big on the wellness front, with a very nice spa & various sauna/relax rooms. Beautifying isn’t my bag but I used the gym which was pretty well equipped with high quality machinery & a divine outlook over countryside. However, I did feel the gym fell second fiddle to the other wellness areas as there was no water provided & often no towels, & in contrast to the rest of the hotel which is utterly pristine, gym equipment could have done with a wipe down. The hotel boasts an indoor & 2 outdoor pools plus various attractive lounging areas. In addition there are complimentary bikes & a golf simulator. Ample private parking & a shuttle, albeit at a charge. Despite the flaws we loved the hotel & always looked forward to returning following our day time jaunts. It’s a very well run establishment & just has a really nice vibe.…"Der Birkenhof Spa & Genuss Resort,bubble_45,"COP 1,662,389","Hofenstetten 55, 92431 Neunburg vorm Wald, Bavaria Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1587189-d1234387-Reviews-Der_Birkenhof_Spa_Genuss_Resort-Neunburg_vorm_Wald_Upper_Palatinate_Bavaria.html,bubble_50,Date of stay: July 2019,3 Helpful votes,"We stayed 1 night as a stop over on our way to Austria.

Roomservice had a good selection and pretty fast delivery. Beautiful and we'll kept grounds with garden, fountains, pools and patios.   Cons: No AC. Remote location means you either eat dinner at the hotel or take a drive. Also, it's a bit of a drive off the Autobahn (which is kind of the point) and some of the roads in the area are narrow rural roads. Take care when reviewing your GPS calculated route if countryside driving isn't your forte.  The glass walls of the bathroom might not be to everyone's liking.

We had a lake on our doorstep and a rowing boat at our disposal.  The spa was lovely and the views from it were surreal. My husband and I both had massages which were great. There were a few glitches - breakfast was incredibly slow but I imagine that was due to covid restrictions. If you wanted food in your villa you needed to order it 24 hours in advance - this is a pain especially with small children. Also, there is only one restaurant which is Michelin starred.

No interest either in talking about wines (even though we mentioned we had drunk a specific wine in the country of origin) or in the guests.

It is situated in little Illhaeusern in the beautiful Alsace with the delights of the Route du Vin at your doorstep and plenty to explore in the area.  The Haeberlin family has created a bit of heaven on earth with their gastronomic temple and sybaritic retreat that embraces with hospitality and an always delightful experience that reminds you that ""life is good.""  This hasn't happened by accident-- but through the dedication of the Haeberlin and Haeberlin/Bauman family.  If Michelin ever created a fourth star-- it should be for this place.  The restaurant continues to be one of the best in France-- continuing the family affair with cuisine.  Both the restaurant and the hotel attend to every detail without being ""fussy!""  In both the restaurant and the hotel you feel like a welcomed and honored guest.  Although there's plenty to do in the area, you could simply luxuriate right there on the property on the banks of the river.  As I swam on my back  in the exquisite pool in the hotel garden I watched several young storks flying overhead. Time for a massage, a nap, a soak in a super-tub, then dinner. Marco Bauman and son and staff and the Haeberlin family have created something very special here.  Mrs. Haeberlin/Bauman graciously welcomes and looks after guests at the restaurant. This place deserves every bit of recognition and praise. So many places have a corporate feel.  This place has a family feel, a warm country feel, a relaxed and elegant feel of excellence, a feeling of  ""I didn't die, but somehow got to heaven.""

This is the best room category before you get to the named suites.  While the suite was very pretty, it was quite tiny.  I was in Paris several times during this trip and on other occasions stayed at the Plaza Athenee and The Ritz, all at similar price points. The Crillon accommodations  were not on a par with either of these hotels; in both cases the suites were considerably larger.  It was the hotel's pettiness in other small things that really got to me.  As we all know, the hotel industry's latest rage is to pretend to be ecologically conscious and generally ask the guest to place a card on the bed if a sheet change is not required. We know that this is a flagrant attempt to save money, the environment be damned.  At the Crillon, the guest must place the card on the bed in order to have the sheets changed.  Who can remember to place a card on the bed when they are racing out to see all that is Paris?  Remember, we're talking about a suite in the range of 3,600 Euros per night.  Another tiny but annoying matter was turndown service.  The night maid would come in and remove all of the dirty towels, but not replace them with new clean ones; that appeared to be the job of the day maids.  On a high point, the L'Ecrin restaurant, a small space hidden inside the ground floor, is a gastronomic gem which will succeed despite its pretenses of creating a meal around the wine chosen.  I am not partial to wine, but the food was excellent.  The Crillon was my late parents' hotel of choice in Paris, and it was mine as well in my younger days.  Sadly, Rosewood has spent a lot of money on the place, but the dedication to hospitality appears to have gone.

For example, my wife wasn’t feeling amazing on our second to last day and asked about whether there was a pharmacy where she could purchase a specialty item. While there is a pharmacy in town, the staff offered to go into town for us, purchase the item, and hand deliver it to our room. We charged the cost of it to our room but the “delivery” was complimentary. Not only was this “above and beyond” but the staff treated us like it was no problem at all. In advance of our trip, they emailed us promptly and made excellent recommendations. They speedily and expertly booked us a boat trip within a few minutes of the request, rearranged reservations, and made us feel welcome. We’ve been fortunate to stay at a number of luxury properties in France, Europe, and around the world, and the service here is top-notch. They are truly always anticipating our wants and needs a step ahead of us. Special shout out to Julia, Salvatore, Emily for their hard work, dedication, and making our stay memorable.

My wife and our youngest son (14) spent 3 nights at the hotel in April and had an amazing time. The hotel is absolutely spectacular and is only surpassed by its staff. We stayed in a deluxe terrace room which was just gorgeous. The room had a nice patio with a great view of the sea and was very comfortable. The room was quite large in that it comfortably slept three of us--my son slept on the sofa bed and said it was very comfortable. The bathroom was fantastic. Everything was spotless.  We visited during the ""low"" season and so only one restaurant was open (the others opened right after we left). We had dinner our first night in the restaurant and then breakfast each morning there as well. Each meal was great and the service was impeccable. The pool at the Club Dauphin is one of the most amazing hotel pools anywhere with simply incredible views. The grounds and the gardens were also beautiful and we enjoyed walking around the gardens.  We did not visit the spa but it also looked amazing. The hotel is at the tip of the peninsula and we spent a great day walking along the ocean into town and also visiting for dinner. It was a remarkable few days and we can't wait to visit as it was surely one of the best hotel stays we have ever had.  I also need to extend a massive thank you to the hotel. I purchased our stay at a breast cancer awareness charity auction in 2019 before COVID as I wanted to take my wife to the south of France for a special birthday trip.  Although the stay was to be completed within 1 year of the auction event, COVID hit and we were unable to make the trip. While the hotel certainly had no obligation to honor the stay, it graciously and without hesitation extended the trip a total of 4 times until we were able to finally go.  I mention this as the hotel should be applauded for its support of breast cancer research and its fantastic customer service in light of COVID.  Well done and we can't wait to visit again!…""Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat, A Four Seasons Hotel",bubble_45,"COP 6,088,012","71 boulevard General de Gaulle, 06230 St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187237-d195666-Reviews-Grand_Hotel_du_Cap_Ferrat_a_Four_Seasons_Hotel-St_Jean_Cap_Ferrat_French_Riviera_Cote_d.html,bubble_10,Date of stay: July 2022,3 Helpful votes,"Well, you really have to hand it to the Four Seasons.  They know how to separate you from your wallet.  But this was over the top!  There are about 75 rooms in this location and all of them except the suites are like 200 sq feet.  There's room for a bed, a small table, a tiny closet and an even tinier bathroom.  It's really ridiculous.  And all for the bargain price of $6,000 per night.    So what do you get for that?  Well, the answer really is nothing.  They don't know you at the front desk despite the fact that you may have stayed hundreds of nights in Four Seasons properties.  They don't know you down at the pool.  Could we have those two lounges over there with the unobstructed sea view and a little bit of privacy?  ""No, merci, they have been rented for the entire month.""  Yeah, that's good but there's no one there and it's 4:30 in the afternoon!  ""No, we can not do that.  II est impossible.""

Yup, you're swimming in a peepie and poopie water hazard.  Avoid it at all costs.  The people watching is entertaining.  There are a lot of thin, sleek pretty women with men who are at least 30 years older with bellies that are distended as if pregnant or maybe just full of cream puffs.

The interior design of the rooms is very impressive and the house keeping crew is immaculate. The whole hotel is very clean and the chrome is always polished. The venue had a very French vibe and the friendliest employee was Alexander; our concierge. He helped us book many actives and some of them were difficult to arrange since we didn't plan anything before our arrival. We went to The Louvre, Champs Elysees, Catacombs, Moulin Rouge, Crazy Horse Show and an amazing Versailles Palace Horseback ride! The restaurant breakfast was lovely. There is a limited 'butik' style all-day menu at the restaurant. They didn't have the expected international 5-star hotel dishes like Caesar salad or shrimp cocktail, the food that they do offer is amazing and the chefs are very talented. If you stay longer than 3 days then the restaurant menu gets boring. The Spa is very small and Linda who works there is quite stuck-up and unavailable/overworked. When we arrived to the spa reception she said she just finished with a massage customer and she could not attend to us immediately. We waited about 15mins for her to fumble with the computer and then she showed us around the spa. When I asked for a Spa Menu she said she can email it to me. This is unprofessional since the customers shouldn't be expected to check their own email for the jk spa massage price pdf. The second day I went to the Spa there was no one at the reception, the doors were locked and the guests could not even get inside to use the pool. The third day I attempted to book a massage at the spa; The women's lockers had no keys. I had to go behind the spa reception table myself and look for locker keys.  No one was attending the spa at all. They are obviously understaffed. Having only one person work at the Spa is unacceptable and inefficient for guests. The next day I realized that there were two new spa employees and the Spa was back up and functioning. Lara is very friendly and she made my massage experience perfect. Spa Steam room sprayer is broken + steam room faucet is broken and the Sauna door gets stuck this is dangerous because it can not be opened from inside. On our forth day of our stay the ground of our hotel room (22) started shaking and a very loud rumbling noise was coming from the ground. This woke us up at 9:00am and we first thought it was an earthquake. This was actually construction coming from the building next door. In addition to being woken up every weekday by this rumbling we were notified that there would be no hot water for some time. It's been two days now with no hot water to shower with. We were moved to room 30 for our final two days and this room was quieter. Emiliano was  a very friendly waiter. Most of the staff is Italian so we were disappointed with the limited to only 6 item menu. The kitchen staff has a much higher potential than this and I'm sure they could manage with 20 items on the menu. P.s. the menu has photos of random people on the middle section, they said these are photos of the family who owns the place. This is vain and tacky. At 1.900 Euros per night we were expecting a bit more from J.K. place Paris. I'm sure that when they iron out the problems this will actually be at a five star level.…"J.K.

I cannot recommend enough staying here at the gorgeous Royal Champagne Hotel. Not only is this one of the most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed in — and we have been fortunate to stay in many lovely places the world over in Europe, Asia, and the US (and this ranks at the top!) — but the level of hospitality and customer service at this hotel are second to none. We had a brief amount of time to spend in the Champagne region before leaving to attend our friend’s wedding in Versailles, and it goes without saying that we wanted to maximize it to the fullest extent. So we leaned on the concierge team, who were agile in setting us up with Champagne house tours at Bollinger, Ruinart, and Moët et Chandon; plus a lovely lunch at Cellier Belle Époque, the Champagne bar and restaurant of the house of Perrier-Jouët. All were stellar and we were able to see our favorite houses with lovely tasting and cellar tours.   The hotel also arranged ground transportation for us from Charles de Galles airport in Paris to the hotel and then from the hotel to our next destination in Versailles.   The food is absolutely delicious. The gorgeous breakfast buffet and dinner are served in Le Bellevue, which is a stellar restaurant with exquisite crystal lighting fixtures with the most breathtaking view of a valley of vineyards in Champagne. The view alone from the terrace is reason to stay! But of course the real fun comes when you go out and about in the region and explore the lovely villages of Epernay, Reims, and Aÿ. The Royal Champagne Hotel is the perfect spot to return to at night and celebrate a day well spent.   I highly highly recommend this as a place to really luxuriate and enjoy. If you are interested in winemaking and the complex art of Champagne, visit the region — and STAY HERE!!!  Big thanks to the spectacular concierge team including Lyse, Margaux, Leon, and the full staff there who work tirelessly to bring their guests a few days of joy in a gorgeous place. We owe it to them for handling our itinerary with such care and diligence and making us feel so welcome and at home. They deserve the highest praise and gratitude from guests.

They even went out of their way to buy me a pair of shoelaces from a local store when mine broke. They were helpful making arrangements for Champagne tours and restaurants, though they led us to a biodynamic champagne house that was interesting but subpar.  The view at Royal Champagne alone is worth the price. Rooms all overlook Epernay and the valley though the second floor is far superior than the first and worth the extra cost.

The staff act like they've been trained to within an inch of their lives, nothing felt natural. Don't get me wrong - everyone was very friendly but it all felt a bit false. They are all still having to wear masks in the hotel too so we couldn't understand a word that was said when we were shown around (again not their fault).  We had a corner room with a terrace and spectacular views. The room was very small with no separate shower and the terrace was overlooked by the restaurant so we weren't comfortable sunbathing as a couple of the tables (the most popular ones) looked down on us. The breakfast was very good but they forgot our coffees - however the food was delicious. The pool is tiny, but there were always sunbeds available (unless you wanted the one ""under the lemon trees"") We so wanted to love this hotel and I'm really not sure why we didn't - I think the word that summed it up was claustrophobic - but maybe that's the Amalfi Coast for you? On a final note they washed our car for us and supplied us with a lovely packed breakfast which was great.

They have such a FABULOUS variety of breakfast foods, including yogurts/green juices/eggs/egg whites/fruit (best mango I have ever had) and more.

The restaurant is very good and with a rich menu, which, however, did not change for a week. Every day, however, there was a ""day menu"" with one new option per course.

The restaurant is well-designed to ensure privacy for each visitor. You sit at the same table each night which is a little unusual - but it enables them to ensure you're addressed in your preferred language by all the staff.  The food at dinner is a delight - both the ""detox"" menu which is mostly vegetarian and often vegan, and the ""regular"" menu. Each meal is a combination of simple salads and soups with some fine-dining style plates - it's seven courses a night which means your dinners do take a long time however. The breakfast is perhaps even better with a huge range of tasty, fresh options - the best hotel breakfast I've had in Europe.  We tried the wine tasting which was pricey at 95 euros per person, but the wines were delicious, the sommelier informative and friendly, and the views spectacular. We also did a variety of hikes in the area including a guided hike by ""Onkel Herbert"", the uncle of the proprietor of the hotel. Definitely worth it, though Herbert speaks very little English, so get ready to converse in German with him or have a phrase-book (or google translate) handy.  Finally, we booked half board which felt easily worth it. The size of the breakfasts and dinners meant that we never needed lunch, but the hotel is pretty isolated so it's not that easy to go out for dinner.

My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon and we were absolutely blown away by every part of our experience. We were greeted with champagne, flowers and chocolates in our room, and had beautiful roses at our dinner table each night.   Do yourself a favor and stay in the Tower Suite - the floor to ceiling windows mean waking up to stunning views of the Dolomites each morning. The backdrop of the mountains changed throughout the day with the weather and we felt like we were constantly seeing something new.   The hotel is tucked away in the mountains, creating a peaceful environment. The only noise we heard throughout our stay was birds chirping! We loved the spa as well and spent almost half the day there. The outdoor and indoor pools are connected and each heated, making swimming comfortable even with a slight breeze outside. There’s also a great gym and saunas that we took advantage of.   The food at Forestis was next level. We enjoyed breakfast outside on the patio and dinner each night in the stunning restaurant. We loved the privacy of our designated booth in the restaurant for dinner. As a vegan, I was blown away by the pre-fixe detox menu. The dishes were so flavorful and featured local produce that changed each night. Breakfast (which is included if you opt for the half board) was by far the best hotel breakfast I’ve ever had.   We also enjoyed pre-dinner drinks, including a local gin cocktail and local wines, at the lovely hotel bar.  The convenient location made hiking a breeze. The hotel is located directly next to the chairlift that took us up to local hiking trails. We also stopped midway at a local Refugio for some delicious lunch!  While remote, there are several options for getting to the hotel. We flew into the Innsbruck Airport and worked with the hotel to arrange for a driver to pick us up. We unfortunately had several travel issues due to Lufthansa and the hotel couldn’t have been more accommodating - communicating on our behalf to the driver and greeting us upon arrival despite arriving 9+ hours late.   I can’t recommend Forestis enough if you’re looking for a romantic hideaway in the Dolomites, and I’m already dreaming of our next visit.…"Forestis Dolomites,bubble_50,,"Palmschoss 22, 39042, Bressanone Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g194703-d1723403-Reviews-Forestis_Dolomites-Bressanone_Province_of_South_Tyrol_Trentino_Alto_Adige.html,bubble_50,Date of stay: May 2022,1 Helpful vote,"You cannot fault this brand new beautiful hotel in the Dolomites.

As it was our first time visiting, we appreciated the central location and its proximity to the other side of the river to explore different neighborhoods such as Piazza Santo Spirito. We felt very welcome upon arrival, and we enjoyed the included breakfast (based on our room rate) each morning. We noticed a variety of guests staying there—couples of all ages, families, etc. Being a fan of Salvatore Ferragamo, it was v enjoyable to see the integration of the brand in the room decor, toiletries, and more. We had free access to the Ferragamo museum though ran out of time to visit it unfortunately. Our hotel card provided 10% off at various sister hotel locations, too, such as La Terrazza. Compared to other hotels where we stayed in Italy (also 5 star), Portrait offered the most pre-visit communication which was certainly a prelude to the high-touch concierge approach from all staff — (versus just one or two go-to concierge). Because we already purchased your tickets and planned excursions, we did not need to take full advantage of the concierge offerings; but it was obvious that if someone needed assistance planning or replanning their entire Firenze stay the concierge would 100% be able and willing to help. The only mild disappointment was that we could hear conversations of other guests through the main bathroom wall, and we heard a lot of slamming (doors? the room above? was unclear) at various points in the evening. That said, things seemed to quiet down at some point in the evening until the next morning; and we didn’t complain to the staff, as we chalked it up to the age of the building and part of the experience. The turndown service was good, and they provided a complimentary bottle of water each evening.

The hotel is small, I think there are only 18 rooms and suites, but it is beautiful, a jewel box of amazing quality.  We had a junior suite and a very comfortable sofa, a tv that swiveled between sofa and bed (although there is very little to watch in English and we couldn't get our phones to work with their streaming software).

Hotel popular for weddings and American parties so main hotel could be noisy at times. Service from all depts was excellent. Views from the terrace and restaurant stunning and very comfortable but the wasps and flies were a nuisance and we felt there should be burners or at least citronella to deter them as this works in other hot countries we visit.  The price of drinks was surprisingly high,  even by most five star standards which really adds to the price of your holiday and needs to be considered if you like a few drinks and wine. A small glass of wine was 30 euros. The sister hotel on the beach is a great facility and the shuttle is efficient every half an hour.  The standard at the beach hotel is equally high,  as are the snacks and drinks. These can be charged to your room at the Timeo which is convenient. We enjoyed a complimentary boat trip around the bay which was a nice gesture for guests to enjoy.  Overall we felt that the hotel was the best location in Taormina and the standard was very high, but travellers should be mindful of the need for a generous budget for meals and drinks if planning to use the property's bar and restaurant. There are a lot of nice places to eat in the town which is just minutes to walk.   Also be aware that on the beach,  they don't warn you about jelly fish often in the shallows and further out so many people were being stung before realising the risk. There are staff clearing debris from the shoreline so it looks pristine but the jelly fish are a nasty surprise.

The buffet is not a real buffet since you need to wait for a staff to serve you from behind a counter and the choice is limited.

Although there is a pillow menu, the standard feather pillows we were provided with are the best one will find anywhere. The new luxury bath towels make such a difference and the bedding is now top quality. Pity about lack of tissues in bathroom. Rooms and suites however enjoy a special 'feel' which should not be mistaken by guests as being outdated, rather they are classic, beautiful, elegant and exactly what is expected by returning guests. Modern twists are carefully blended in, such as television rising from a period style cabinet. This hotel feels like home.  Having stayed at a few of the top hotels in Venice over the years I'm able to make a fair comparison. The loveliest hotels are of course the older hotels including the Cipriani and the Danieli. If you want something modern and new then stay at the JW Marriot (it's a particularly good JWM and could have been branded a Ritz Carlton) and it also has the 2nd best pool in Venice. The Very Best swimming pool to be found in Venice is of course at the Cipriani, where the Olympic sized pool comes with exceptional pool service. Relaxing by this pool takes some beating, not only in Italy but anywhere. Pure La Dolce Vita !  The choice of flowers in red and white outside all balconies compliment the property better than ever as do the floral arrangements throughout the hotel especially opposite the boutiques.  There is now a room next to reception where guests are welcomed. We received a marvellous welcome from Michael (who has been at the Cipriani since before the previous management). On arriving I found there was a new managing director, Mr Marco Novella, who used to head London's unbeatable Lanesborough Hotel. Returning guests will have no problem noticing the improvements.  We were however very disappointed with Cip’s restaurant. We had a table at Cip’s two nights running. Some of the food was tasteless, far too much olive all used which made two different turbot dishes actually taste greasy. I feel complacency has set in and we would never go back. On top of which one of the staff was not very kind or helpful to my wife when she asked for help during a total deluge of rain, my wife actually felt that the staff member was rude to her. I certainly found that the restaurant manager was not interested at all we’re on our second night I tried to explain that the food was disappointing. Both dinners at Cip’s were 3rd rate. I only complained the first night in the hope that they would resolve their kitchen problem ready for our second night. No such luck. We stay at the Cipriani so we can stroll over to Cip’s, then relax at the bar and enjoy the property. Walter the barman has gone and the standard has gone down. There is no consistency in the way cocktails are made and as for a Bellini, don’t bother. Sometimes there is far too much peach purée in the mix, other times there is not quite enough. Sometimes you get a full glass of Bellini, other times it comes 50% full of froth. For a perfect Bellini go to where it was invented, Harrys Bar where it is always perfect and consistent.  Given the price is charged at the restaurant and bar, guests are entitled to a good standard. Also, the Cipriani used to have a really great pianist who gave the bar atmosphere at night. On our first night, after dining at Cip’s, the atmosphere at the bar was reminiscent of being in a morgue. The live music was a monotonous dirge. We stood for two minutes and decided we couldn’t face it. The management should take a leaf from the wonderful entertainment at Belmond Splendido in Portofino where there is a fantastic atmosphere during and after dinner. On the second night the five piece band were monotonously going through the motions from their sheet music. No feel, no personality and no atmosphere.  On a positive note, the breakfasts at the Cipriani are very good indeed. Also all of the staff at breakfast are lovely. They are so friendly and welcoming and extremely together that it makes for a great start to the day. After staying for two nights at the Cipriani we moved to the Danieli Hotel. The offering at breakfasts at the Cipriani are easily twice as good as at the Danieli. However the Danieli bar at night has great atmosphere and a wonderful pianist who also sings who was so good we spent over two hours…and a lot of Euros, at their great bar. The wonderful Danielli cocktail list put the Cipriani list to shame.  Of all the top of the hotels in Venice, we would not normally consider staying anywhere except the Cipriani. With poor F and B (apart from breakfast) and a depressing night bar, our need to stay at the Cipriani is no more.  While the hotel accomodation itself was starting to get a little tired, this has been reversed by the new manager. Service, rooms and suites, the extensive gardens, facilities...everything (apart from Cip’s and the bar) is better than ever. As for the pleasure of breakfasts...the setting is so lovely and the service so perfect that it has to be unbeatable in whole of Venice. There used to be a bird problem at breakfast as well as a wasp problem at certain times of the year. Not any more. Annoying birds who would try and steal food in front of diners are now frightened by the sight of a hawk been carried about the restaurant by an experienced hawk handler. Problem solved. Brilliant. More top hotels should do this. Also on every table was a plastic contraption with wasp food inside so instead of bothering diners the wasps are attracted by this, have some food and then fly away. I’ve never seen this before anywhere.  Cipriani really should deliver the most wonderful guest experience as do so many of the incredible Belmond hotels around the world at other amazing locations, especially in Peru. One of us was staying at Belmond Iguazo Falls, Brazil earlier this month and that was off-the-scale exceptional ... and their restaurant was Belmond at their best. Incredible cuisine.  One final word of praise...Andrea, who greets and helps arriving guests climb off the various boats...(not always simple especially with older and disabled ) guests .... provides a careful and considerate service...no matter the water level. in fact arriving to a welcome from Andrea and Michael (reception manager) is lovely.  All things considered, I can’t give the Cipriani a five star rating for this visit and we don’t feel like returning. I am going to review Cip’s in detail separately. At no point did I ask or expect anything to be deducted from our hotel bill. I tried to pay the bill in full on departing however the Cipriani insisted on not charging us for one of our two dinners at Cip's. This did not make up for the disappointment caused (we had brought an 80 year old relative to Venice with us for her first ever visit) but at least the failures were acknowledged by the hotel manager.…""Cipriani, A Belmond Hotel, Venice",bubble_45,,"Giudecca 10, 30133 Venice Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187870-d194297-Reviews-Cipriani_A_Belmond_Hotel_Venice-Venice_Veneto.html,bubble_40,Date of stay: September 2022,,Excellent five star service throughout our two nights stay.

Truly perfect Italian service, effortlessly welcoming and helpful but unobtrusive in the Italian way. The hotel remains the oasis of calm it has always been, tucked away in Giudecca, but for the first time, the famous pool came into its own.
