The hotel is in a wonderful location - it's within walking distance of the Louvre, the shopping district, many restaurants, and even the Musee d'Orsay and the Eiffel Tower are within a bit longer walking distance. It's also located close to 2 metro stops. The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are comfortable and clean, and the breakfast is exceptional. There is also a small buffet available all day with non-alcoholic drinks. The mini bar is also restocked daily - no alcohol but water and juices.

Location: Great location in Paris. Easy to get around and close to the Metro and really in a great spot to walk everywhere.   Hotel: We had the privilege room with 3 people. It is of course small but perfectly laid out and honestly, we didn’t feel squished at all. Room is lovely. No complaints at all. Minibar in the room is a great touch and helps to just grab a drink after a long tourist day. The hotel breakfast was great - nice selection and constantly refilled. It was perfect. The people are all lovely and super helpful.   I can see why this hotel has so many amazing reviews and I’m happy that we booked here. Don’t hesitate to book this one for your trip to Paris.

It is clean, uniquely quiet,  has the amenities one expects in this category without missing a step, and they are priced in the right category.  But the service is super exceptional, and sets the hotel apart.  I do not remember being welcomed so warmly and being treated with such care.  And having snacks and drinks in the lobby made us feel comfortable and at home.  They just make the stay easy for you.  A special thank you to Mr. Hazam who saved our flight.  Were it not for your advice to leave earlier, we would have missed our plane.  CDG processing was approximately 2.5 hours, with priority access.  Your recommended leave time was absolutely perfect.  Thank you so very much for your intervention!  And thank you for the snacks :)  We had left just before breakfast and Mr. Hazam packed us some snacks and had it ready for us when we came down.  That was above and beyond going above and beyond.  Big thank you!    Overall this hotel executes very well.  It's rare to stay somewhere without some annoyance, because you are away from home, but these folks have quietly eliminated common annoyances for you, so that you do feel more at home.  And then on top of that, the desk staff truly cares about your experience, such that whatever your preference or situation, they will make things easy and comfortable.

Clean rooms and balcony view over one of the pools - extending to the sea beyond.  You can catch a sunrise from the beach - because it's on the west coast.  The west coast is also far less windy - allowing for some wonderful boat trips.  The sea is warm and welcoming - though the beaches are shingle/stone- so some water shoes recommended.  Poolside service via an app - or the swim up bar is excellent - along with any food you may want. Both served quickly and of excellent quality.  The bar staff... Stratos, Stephanos and Liiliana are so lovely. Young, fun and cheery.   At the restaurant we were greeted daily by the lovely Pari who was delightful, friendly and always helpful.  She always had a smile and a welcome to make us feel like old friends.    The room itself was clean with fresh linen & towels whenever you needed.

For our stay in May we booked a Junior Suite (1st Floor) and in July a Standard Side Sea room (3rd Floor) both in the main hotel.  My husband and I have stayed in many hotels on differing Greek islands and this little piece of heaven knocks spots off the rest.  I could ramble on about the cleanliness of the rooms, the gardens, the pool and the beach along with the high quality food on offer every day and the international branded alcohol and local wine which we both founds superb (the dry Rose is excellent) but you will read all about these wonder factors on everybody else's reviews - I guarantee it because it is true, regardless of how full the hotel was (bearing in mind we have seem both early and mid season capacity).  As impressed as I was/am about how the hotel looked, I was more impressed with how the staff were as I consider it a real reflection on the Management of a hotel.  interesting fact coming up;  Staff do not leave the Atrium Palace very often (that tells you one thing for a start) and it is not easy to get a position there - regardless of what that position is.  Staff want to be there and that is clearly evident on how they work. Whether you are bumping into a member of the Housekeeping Team first thing in the morning, or passing a Bell Boy last thing at night, you will always be cordially greeted, and they recruit locally to the Hotel whenever possible. They feel appreciated by their Management and this had a direct reflection on how they treat their guests.   We had a delay in our flight home (well actually many but that's another story) but without fuss or ado, the staff continued to treat us a guests for the following 18 hours and went over and above to try to alleviate some of stress we were experiencing.   I asked to see the Manager, Apostolos to express our appreciation of their kindness and was told he would be over to see us in 5 minutes - which we was. No hiding behind office doors at this hotel!  Time for some mentions, which if you are going to book this hotel, I would make note of because they are such good ambassadors of the hotel group.  Savvas, Sortiris and the wonderful Nathalia in the restaurant will guide you to your table in the Dining Hall.  Rena will serve you excellent coffee with a smile throughout the day at the main bar.  Stratos, Stefano, Beatrice and Francesca will keep you topped up with drinks and snacked as the pool bar. (Beatrice and Francesca will also be in the main bar in the evenings and once they've served you, they remember not only your order but your room numbers also!)  Irini and Ioannis will keep your coffee and fresh orange juice topped up at breakfast and advise of the al la carte meals in the evening.  And Lucas at the beach will supply you fresh towels and greet you with a friendly fist pump.  We salute you all for your constant hard work in making sure everybody's holiday is as relaxing as it is memorable.

The hotel has loads of sunbeds at the beach and the pools, set up in pairs under parasols which are numbered as part of the app ordering system.  We never once struggled to find group of 6 beds for our party . The food was pretty good - standard buffet with daily variations for the theme which are cooked to order. The only complaint in our party was the omelettes - not very well cooked and very little range/variety in the fillings. The service was superb - especially the golf cart to transport us from reception to our rooms on checkin! Other than the 1 barman the staff were brilliant. There are 2 shower rooms to use on checkout day which can be booked for free for half hour slots so you can wash before leaving. The only niggle was that the decor, furnishings etc, whilst being perfectly fit-for purpose, in good nick and very well cleaned/maintained, they were poor in their design and cohesion - they completely failed to create a feel-good feeling. Basically they should have used a much better interior designer and spent a little bit more.

It is located at the highest point in Gorëme, and if you go to the huge terrace bar above, you will not regret. On top of the terrace bar, there is a second, smaller terrace, and there, you are at the top of Gorëme, with a magnificent 360 degrees view, where I made a very nice video. If you drive to the hotel by car, be patient on the winding streets up, since the tourist vans will annoy you and block the streets quite often. Note: this hotel is not ""downtown"", is at the top of the Goreme hill, with the best views. You have to decide if you prefer the unforgettable view, or the busy area. The staff is really friendly. They have their own local travel arrangements, and we could book a balloon flight and a Dervish ceremony. Eliz or Kenan are helpful to inform you about the details and arrangements. They will ask you to pay the trips in cash, to avoid credit card commissions to you (you can, of course, pay with card). Therefore, consider bringing cash if you book trips with them. Surely you can withdraw locally, but all ATMs in Turkey charge you high commissions. At the first sight, the breakfast looked a bit “lean” to me (e.g.: no scrambled eggs), but they take your orders for that, or omelettes. The breakfast room also has a sunny terrace with nice views. Surely the variety may improve a bit. The place is very cosy, and the access to some rooms may be funny, via outside stairs. If you bring heavy luggage, ask for help. No elevator available... The room was spacious and the decoration was vintage. The room windows don’t have noise abatement, therefore it is recommended to bring earplugs. My room was facing the street where the vans pick-up the tourists for the balloon trip in the middle of the night, and it was noisy. Be aware of that.

Should you happen to have forgotten anything essential at home, there are also multiple stores nearby (Boots, Tesco Express, Superdrug, Sainsbury Local), which was great since we had our 8-year old son with us.  As far as the hotel itself, we found our room very spacious (especially by European standards), and the built-in USB chargers were helpful (we brought enough adapters with us but some people may not). The Nespresso machine and mini-fridge was a lifesaver, as I really need my morning coffee with real milk to get going. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We were on the fifth floor and it was so quiet you would have never guessed that we were in such a busy area of central London.  There are only two minor nitpicks I can think of. The first is that the doors for the kitchenette didn't shut properly, so the light remained on (it turns off when the doors are closed). We engineered a DIY solution and in fairness we never mentioned it to the staff. The second thing was a few days while we were out, we indicated on our door that we were not in our room. Despite that our room was not serviced that day. For us it didn't matter because we simply reused our towels and any toiletries were supplied promptly upon asking. But some guests may have disliked being skipped for a housekeeping visit.   Overall we were extremely happy with this hotel. We were there for 10 days and after a long day visiting museums and seeing sights, it really felt like a nice, comfortable place to retire for the evening. When we return to London this place will be right at the top of our list!…"The Resident Covent Garden,bubble_50,"COP 1,499,780","51 Bedford Street, London WC2R 0PZ England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d15134890-Reviews-The_Resident_Covent_Garden-London_England.html,bubble_50,Date of stay: September 2022,1 Helpful vote,I loved this hotel.

From the first moment we wished we had stayed much longer. Our room was quiet, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the staff was delightful. Best of all is the neighborhood, around the corner from Covent Garden Market and a short walk from the National Gallery, shops, restaurants, and other attractions. As an added bonus, our room had a spacious balcony with views of charming London roof tops and the Eye.

The location was an outstanding base for exploring London--close to multiple Underground lines, tons of buses around the corner on the Strand, and walkable to lots of restaurants, shopping, and West End theaters.
